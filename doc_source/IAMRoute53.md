# AWS Identity and Access Management<a name="IAMRoute53"></a>

AWS Cloud Map integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\), a service that your organization can use to do the following actions:
+ Create users and groups under your organization's AWS account
+ Share your AWS account resources among the users in the account in an efficient manner
+ Assign unique security credentials to each user
+ Granularly control user access to services and resources

For example, you can use IAM with AWS Cloud Map to control which users in your AWS account can create a new namespace or register instances\.
